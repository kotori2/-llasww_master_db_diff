Cookies are used to maintain information about a user's visit to an application, website or game, such as user names, passwords and individual preferences. The Services may send cookies to your computer when you access the Services. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your Personal Information.

7.        Security of Your Information

7.1        It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify Bushiroad International of any unauthorized use of your account.

7.2        Bushiroad International takes commercially reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and customer records but no website or internet transmission is completely secure. Bushiroad International does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. Bushiroad International urges you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. In addition, if your SNS account is hacked, it may lead to unauthorized use of Services you have procured so be careful to keep your account information secure.
